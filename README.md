Normal Mode Wizard
==================

Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz) is a [VMD][] plugin designed for visual analysis of normal mode data. Modes may come from principal component, essential dynamics, normal mode analysis or may be any vector describing a molecular motion.

NMWiz can be used for:

* performing ANM, GNM, and PCA/EDA calculations via ProDy
* drawing customizable normal mode arrows
* making animations and sampling conformations
* making interactive square-fluctuations and cross-correlations plots
* comparing pairs of structures and drawing deformation vectors
