Normal Mode Wizard
==================

Normal Mode Wizard (NMWiz) is a [VMD][] plugin designed for visual comparative
analysis of normal mode data. Modes may come from principal component,
essential dynamics, normal mode analysis or may be any vector describing a
molecular motion.

NMWiz can be used for:

 * performing ANM, GNM, and PCA/EDA calculations via ProDy
 * drawing customizable normal mode arrows
 * making animations (sample conformations)
 * making interactive square-fluctuations and cross-correlations plots
 * comparing two structures and drawing deformation arrows
